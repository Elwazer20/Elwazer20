# Hello! 👋 I'm Ahmed Elwazer

I'm **Ahmed Elwazer**, a passionate Flutter developer from **Egypt 🇪🇬** with a sharp eye for UI/UX and a deep understanding of scalable mobile app architecture. I specialize in building **clean, maintainable, and performant** applications using **Flutter and Dart**.

I love breaking down complex problems into reusable, testable, and organized layers following the **Clean Architecture (MVVM)** principles. My apps are optimized for performance, adaptability, and beautiful user experiences. Whether it’s handling **state management with Cubit/BLoC**, integrating third-party APIs, or crafting responsive UI components — I build every line of code with **clarity and purpose**.

I'm not just a developer — I'm a product-minded engineer who values the balance between good code and great UX.
